# React app to generate circular cards similar to the game Word A Round

## The reason of this project
My wife is a language teacher and she liked the idea to use this game as a way to make their students memorize words and increase their vocabulary.

## Usage

The latest version of this webapp is published using Github actions at [dzegarra.github.io/letra-a-letra/](https://dzegarra.github.io/letra-a-letra/).

## Features

- You can choose 3 words per card
- The colors are customizable
- Two modes to input or change words: Preview and Table
- Export and import projects
- Remembers the last project
- Generates a PDF document ready to be use
- If you have a duplex printer, you can choose interleave the pages to save time

### Instructions

> The web app remembers the active project between refreshes. For this reason you can only work on a single project at any given time.

- Press the Add Card button located at the bottom right corner to add cards at the end of the stack.
- To change the words of the cards:
  - Preview mode: Hover the card and use the buttons that will appear in its center
  - Table mode: Just change the words in the table cells
- Use the button below the one you use to add cards to change the colors (available in Preview mode only).
- Use the buttons Export and Import to download and restore your project into or from a file. So you can continue them later.
- Once you finish, press the button to generate a PDF (located in the header) to configure and create the document.
